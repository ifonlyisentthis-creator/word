APP NAME:
  Afterword — Secure Time-Locked Vault

SHORT DESCRIPTION (80 characters max):
  Encrypt messages. Set a timer. Deliver them when the time comes.

FULL DESCRIPTION:

Afterword is a secure, time-locked digital vault for the words you may never say — but want someone to receive someday.

Write encrypted messages, record private audio, and assign a trusted recipient for each one. Set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, your vault stays sealed. If the timer ever expires, Afterword delivers your entries exactly as you intended.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Create encrypted vault entries — text or audio
2. Set a check-in timer (30 days free, up to 10 years with Lifetime)
3. Assign a recipient for each entry
4. Check in regularly to keep your vault locked
5. If the timer expires, entries are securely delivered via email
6. Or choose Protocol Zero to permanently erase entries instead

SECURITY FIRST
- End-to-end encryption — your content is encrypted on your device before upload
- Zero-knowledge architecture — we never see your plaintext content
- Integrity seals prevent tampering with recipient addresses
- Recipients decrypt messages in their browser using a private key
- No analytics, no trackers, no advertising

FEATURES
- Encrypted text and audio vault entries
- Customizable check-in timer
- Push notification reminders at key intervals
- Beautiful themes and animated Soul Fire check-in orb
- Recovery phrase backup for your encryption keys
- Automatic 30-day cleanup of delivered entries
- Protocol Zero: permanent data erasure mode (Pro)
- Audio vault with encrypted recording (Lifetime)

PLANS
- Free: 3 text entries, 30-day timer, 3 themes, push reminders
- Pro: Unlimited text, custom timer (7–365 days), Protocol Zero, email alerts, all themes
- Lifetime: Everything in Pro + encrypted audio vault, timer up to 10 years, permanent access

Your vault. Your words. Your terms.

TITLE:
  I built Afterword — a time-locked encrypted vault for messages you want delivered if something happens to you

BODY:

Hey everyone,

I built Afterword, and I'm excited to share it with you.

It's a secure, time-locked digital vault. You write encrypted messages (or record audio), assign a recipient, and set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, everything stays sealed. If you ever stop checking in and the timer runs out, your entries get securely delivered to whoever you chose.

Think of it as a personal time capsule with a dead man's switch — except everything is end-to-end encrypted, and we literally cannot read your content.

Some things that make it different:
- All encryption happens on your device before anything touches a server
- Recipients get a secure browser link + private key to decrypt — no app needed
- You can also set entries to "Protocol Zero" which permanently erases them instead of sending
- Audio vault for voice messages (Lifetime plan)
- Beautiful animated Soul Fire check-in orb
- Recovery phrase backup so you never lose your keys

It's free to use with 3 text entries and a 30-day timer. Pro and Lifetime unlock more.

Subject: I built something — would love your feedback

Hey [Name],

I've been working on an app called Afterword and it just went live on Google Play.

It's a secure, time-locked vault. You write encrypted messages or record audio, assign a recipient, and set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, everything stays locked. If you stop checking in and the timer runs out, your entries get delivered to whoever you chose — all end-to-end encrypted.

I'd really appreciate if you could download it, try it out, and let me know what you think. Even a quick review on the Play Store would mean a lot.

Thanks!
