APP NAME:
  Afterword — Secure Time-Locked Vault

SHORT DESCRIPTION (80 characters max):
  Encrypt messages. Set a timer. Deliver them when the time comes.

FULL DESCRIPTION:

Afterword is a secure, time-locked digital vault for the words you may never say — but want someone to receive someday.

Write encrypted messages, record private audio, and assign a trusted recipient for each one. Set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, your vault stays sealed. If the timer ever expires, Afterword delivers your entries exactly as you intended.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Create encrypted vault entries — text or audio
2. Set a check-in timer (30 days free, up to 10 years with Lifetime)
3. Assign a recipient for each entry
4. Check in regularly to keep your vault locked
5. If the timer expires, entries are securely delivered via email
6. Or choose Protocol Zero to permanently erase entries instead

SECURITY FIRST
- End-to-end encryption — your content is encrypted on your device before upload
- Zero-knowledge architecture — we never see your plaintext content
- Integrity seals prevent tampering with recipient addresses
- Recipients decrypt messages in their browser using a private key
- No analytics, no trackers, no advertising

FEATURES
- Encrypted text and audio vault entries
- Customizable check-in timer
- Push notification reminders at key intervals
- Beautiful themes and animated Soul Fire check-in orb
- Recovery phrase backup for your encryption keys
- Automatic 30-day cleanup of delivered entries
- Protocol Zero: permanent data erasure mode (Pro)
- Audio vault with encrypted recording (Lifetime)

PLANS
- Free: 3 text entries, 30-day timer, 3 themes, push reminders
- Pro: Unlimited text, custom timer (7–365 days), Protocol Zero, email alerts, all themes
- Lifetime: Everything in Pro + encrypted audio vault, timer up to 10 years, permanent access

Your vault. Your words. Your terms.

TITLE:
  I built Afterword — a time-locked encrypted vault for messages you want delivered if something happens to you

BODY:

Hey everyone,

I built Afterword, and I'm excited to share it with you.

It's a secure, time-locked digital vault. You write encrypted messages (or record audio), assign a recipient, and set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, everything stays sealed. If you ever stop checking in and the timer runs out, your entries get securely delivered to whoever you chose.

Think of it as a personal time capsule with a dead man's switch — except everything is end-to-end encrypted, and we literally cannot read your content.

Some things that make it different:
- All encryption happens on your device before anything touches a server
- Recipients get a secure browser link + private key to decrypt — no app needed
- You can also set entries to "Protocol Zero" which permanently erases them instead of sending
- Audio vault for voice messages (Lifetime plan)
- Beautiful animated Soul Fire check-in orb
- Recovery phrase backup so you never lose your keys

It's free to use with 3 text entries and a 30-day timer. Pro and Lifetime unlock more.

Available on Google Play: [LINK]

I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or questions. Happy to answer anything about the architecture or security model.

Subject: I built something — would love your feedback

Hey [Name],

I've been working on an app called Afterword and it just went live on Google Play.

It's a secure, time-locked vault. You write encrypted messages or record audio, assign a recipient, and set a check-in timer. As long as you keep checking in, everything stays locked. If you stop checking in and the timer runs out, your entries get delivered to whoever you chose — all end-to-end encrypted.

I'd really appreciate if you could download it, try it out, and let me know what you think. Even a quick review on the Play Store would mean a lot.

  A-Z PLAY STORE LAUNCH GUIDE — COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP
  Generated: February 2026
================================================================================
================================================================================

This guide covers EVERY step to go from development to production on Google Play,
including RevenueCat, code changes, APK generation, store setup, testers, and launch.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  PHASE 1 — CODE & CONFIGURATION CHANGES (BEFORE BUILDING)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1.1  REVENUECAT: SWITCH FROM SANDBOX TO PRODUCTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) Go to https://app.revenuecat.com → Your project → API Keys
  b) Copy the PRODUCTION Google Play API key (starts with "goog_...")
     - NOT the sandbox/test key
  c) In your GitHub repository, go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
  d) Update these secrets:
     - REVENUECAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY → paste the PRODUCTION key
  e) In your code, the RevenueCat API key is passed at build time via
     --dart-define. Check your build command / CI workflow:

     File: .github/workflows/ (your build workflow)
     Look for: --dart-define=REVENUECAT_API_KEY=...

     Make sure this uses the PRODUCTION key, not the test/sandbox key.

  f) In the app code, RevenueCat is configured in:
     File: lib/main.dart → _deferredInit() method
     Line: Purchases.configure(PurchasesConfiguration(rcApiKey)...)

     The key comes from: const rcApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('REVENUECAT_API_KEY');
     This is set at BUILD TIME via --dart-define. No code change needed —
     just make sure your build command passes the production key.

1.2  REVENUECAT DASHBOARD SETUP (on app.revenuecat.com)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) Go to your project → Google Play Store section
  b) Upload your Google Play Service Account JSON key:
     - Go to Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
     - Find the service account for your Play Console
     - Create a JSON key → download it
     - Upload to RevenueCat under Google Play Store → Service Credentials
  c) Create Products (if not already done):
     - Go to RevenueCat → Products
     - Add products matching your Play Console in-app products:
       • afterword_pro_monthly  → $1.99/month
       • afterword_pro_yearly   → $19.99/year
       • afterword_lifetime     → $99.99 one-time
  d) Create Offerings:
     - Go to RevenueCat → Offerings → "default"
     - Add packages:
       • $rc_monthly → afterword_pro_monthly
       • $rc_annual  → afterword_pro_yearly
       • $rc_lifetime → afterword_lifetime
  e) Create Entitlements:
     - "pro" entitlement → attach all 3 products
  f) Enable Google Play Real-Time Developer Notifications (RTDN):
     - In Play Console → Monetize → Monetization setup → Real-time notifications
     - Set topic to your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic
     - In RevenueCat → Google Play Store → enter the same Pub/Sub topic

1.3  SUPABASE: VERIFY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) Ensure your Supabase project is the PRODUCTION project (not a dev instance)
  b) In GitHub Secrets, verify:
     - SUPABASE_URL → your production Supabase URL
     - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY → your production anon key
  c) In the app code, Supabase is configured in:
     File: lib/main.dart → main() function
     The URL and anon key come from --dart-define at build time.
  d) Run all pending SQL migrations on your PRODUCTION Supabase:
     - v40_checkin_cooldown_guard.sql
     - v41_reset_timer_on_first_entry.sql
     (Check IMPORTANT/All SQL I have ran so far in sequence.txt for the full list)

1.4  FIREBASE: VERIFY PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) Ensure google-services.json in android/app/ is from your PRODUCTION Firebase project
  b) In GitHub Secrets, verify:
     - FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON → production Firebase SA for heartbeat push
  c) FCM is configured automatically via google-services.json — no code changes needed

1.5  RESEND (EMAIL SERVICE): VERIFY PRODUCTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) In GitHub Secrets, verify:
     - RESEND_API_KEY → production Resend API key
     - RESEND_FROM_EMAIL → afterword.app@gmail.com (or your verified domain)
  b) Make sure your domain is verified in Resend dashboard for deliverability

1.6  APP VERSION & BUILD NUMBER
──────────────────────────────
  a) Open pubspec.yaml
  b) Set version to your launch version:
     version: 1.0.0+1
     Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD_NUMBER
  c) Each upload to Play Store needs a UNIQUE, HIGHER build number
     e.g., 1.0.0+1, then 1.0.1+2, etc.

1.7  APP SIGNING KEY (CRITICAL — DO THIS ONCE, KEEP FOREVER)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  a) Generate a keystore (if you haven't already):

     keytool -genkey -v -keystore afterword-release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias afterword

     - Remember the password — you CANNOT change it later
     - Store the .jks file somewhere SAFE (backup to cloud)
     - NEVER commit it to git

  b) Create android/key.properties:

     storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
     keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
     keyAlias=afterword
     storeFile=../../afterword-release.jks

     (path is relative to android/app/)
     Add key.properties to .gitignore

  c) Configure android/app/build.gradle to use the keystore:
     Your build.gradle should already have a signingConfigs section.
     If not, add:

     def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
     def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
     if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
         keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
     }

     android {
         signingConfigs {
             release {
                 keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
                 keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
                 storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
                 storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
             }
         }
         buildTypes {
             release {
                 signingConfig signingConfigs.release
             }
         }
     }

────────────────────────
  Send them this:

  ---
  Subject: Help me test Afterword before launch!

  Hey [Name],

  I need your help testing my app before it goes live on the Play Store.

  WHAT IS AFTERWORD?
  Afterword is a secure, time-locked digital vault. You write encrypted
  messages, set a check-in timer, and assign a recipient. If you ever
  stop checking in and the timer expires, your entries are automatically
  delivered to your chosen recipients. Think of it as a personal time
  capsule with a dead man's switch.

  USE CASES TO TRY:
  1. Create an account (Google sign-in)
  2. Add a vault entry — write a short message, set action to "Send",
     enter a recipient email (use your own email to test delivery)
  3. Tap and hold the Soul Fire orb on the home screen to check in
  4. Try different themes in the Themes & Soul Fire menu
  5. Go to Recovery Phrase to back up your encryption keys
  6. Delete the entry, then create a new one (timer should restart fresh)
  7. Try the subscription flow — purchases are FREE during testing

  HOW TO JOIN:
  1. Click this link: [INTERNAL/CLOSED TESTING LINK]
  2. Accept the test invitation
  3. Install from the Play Store

  Please let me know:
  - Any crashes or errors
  - Anything confusing in the UI
  - Does the timer make sense?
  - Does the encryption feel trustworthy?

  Thanks so much!
  ---

5.4  OPEN TESTING (Optional, unlimited testers)

  a) In RevenueCat → Project Settings
  b) Under "App" section for Google Play:
     - Verify the package name matches: com.yourcompany.afterword
     - Verify the Service Account JSON is uploaded
  c) No "mode switch" needed — RevenueCat automatically uses production
     when the app is downloaded from the real Play Store
  d) Sandbox purchases only work during testing tracks

  PHASE 8 — FRIEND / TESTER USE-CASE SCENARIOS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Share these scenarios with friends who are testing the app:

SCENARIO 1: "The Love Letter"
  You want to write a heartfelt message to your partner that they'll only
  receive if something happens to you. Create a vault entry with action
  "Send", enter their email as recipient, write your message. Check in
  every few weeks to keep it sealed.

SCENARIO 2: "The Business Succession Plan"
  You have passwords, account details, or instructions for your business
  partner. Create vault entries for each piece of information, set the
  recipient to your partner's email. If you become incapacitated, they
  receive everything they need to keep things running.

SCENARIO 3: "Protocol Zero — Destroy Everything"
  You have private notes, journals, or secrets you want permanently
  erased if you're gone. Create entries with action "Protocol Zero".
  When the timer expires, everything is cryptographically destroyed —
  no one ever sees it.

SCENARIO 4: "The Time Capsule"
  Write messages to your future self or loved ones. Set a long timer
  (Lifetime plan: up to 10 years). Stop checking in when you're ready
  for the messages to be delivered.

SCENARIO 5: "Voice From Beyond"
  Record an audio message (Lifetime plan) for someone special. Your
  voice, encrypted and time-locked, delivered only when the time comes.

FULL APP EXPLANATION FOR FRIENDS:
  Afterword is a time-locked vault. You write encrypted messages, record
  audio, or store notes. Each entry has a recipient and an action (send
  or destroy). There's a check-in timer — as long as you hold the Soul
  Fire orb regularly, your vault stays sealed. If you stop checking in
  and the timer expires, Afterword automatically executes your protocol:
  sending entries to recipients or permanently erasing them. Everything
  is end-to-end encrypted — even the app developers cannot read your
  content. Recipients get a secure browser link and a private key to
  decrypt their message. The key is never sent to any server.

  QUICK REFERENCE: FILES TO CHECK BEFORE PRODUCTION BUILD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  pubspec.yaml               → version number
  android/app/build.gradle   → signing config, applicationId, minSdk
  android/app/google-services.json → PRODUCTION Firebase config
  android/key.properties     → keystore path and passwords (NOT in git)
  lib/main.dart              → dart-define keys (set at build time)
  .github/workflows/         → secrets for CI/CD
  GitHub Secrets              → all production keys/URLs
